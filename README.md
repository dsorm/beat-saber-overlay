4. (Optional) For 1080p canvases, add the `scale` modifier (ex. `http://overlay.christiaanbrant.com/?modifiers=scale`) to scale the overlay by 1.5x

## Options

Options are added to the URL query as such:

```
http://overlay.christiaanbrant.com/?modifiers=scale,rtl
```

### `ip` and `port`

Listen to events from another IP and/or port. Add it with a plus if you already have modifiers
```
http://overlay.christiaanbrant.com/?modifiers=scale+ip=127.0.0.1
```

### `modifiers`

Multiple modifiers can be seperated with commas.

- `top`
	* Moves the overlay to the top and reverses the layout vertically
- `rtl`
	* Moves the overlay to the right and uses right-to-left text
- `scale`
	* Scales the overlay by 1.5x, for use on 1080p canvases
- `test`
	* Makes the background black, for testing purposes
